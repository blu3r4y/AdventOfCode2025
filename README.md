Timings are measured on my computer in a non-scientific way.
Empty durations indicate a runtime of less than ten milliseconds.
Bold durations indicate a runtime of more than one minute.

## Requirements

### Python >= 3.14

Package requirements are specified in the [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) file.

```sh
uv sync
```

You should install the [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) to format the code before committing.

```sh
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
